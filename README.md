# Quasar Plain Template by KDJ (quasar-plain-template)
All the templates of Quasar Framework are really great. But I wanted to remove all the unnecessary elements for a developer who likes to develop quasar without additional components. This is my start of quasar repos. All the repos with my Quasar Expereince will be updated with this template.

Anyways, this temnplates includes,
Sass with indented syntax
Auto Import iin-use quasar comonents and directives
Vuex, Axios, Vu-i18n
Yarn

# Added
Dynamic Routes (SPA, PWA, etc)
Quasar Conf
    - vueRouterMode = history
    - const path and quasar-env imported
.env-sample
    - API URL, PUBLIC URL
Axios: env path ready

# Future Updates
.env Support
Store Basics
Sample Pages

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```

### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```
